						<h2>Professional Voice Actor</h2>
					</div>
					<p>I am a professional voice-actor with 5+ years of experience. I have professional training as a stage, film, and voice-over actor. I use an industry standard microphone, so quality is crystal clear and ready for any purpose.</p>

					<p>Some people are cynical about commercials. Not me. I’ve always been interested in what makes people buy things. When you see a book on the shelf, what makes you pick it up, over every other book in the store? What makes you buy one brand of car insurance over another? And what’s going to make you hire me as your voice-over talent instead of someone else? ;)</p>
					<p>Your company’s unique voice will be the thing customers think of first when deciding whether to buy what you’re selling, or to go with the other guy. So, doesn’t it make sense to hire a voice talent that actually wants to work for you? A lot of voice actors only do commercials because they pay the bills. But I don’t want to do your commercial just because it’ll make me a decent chunk of change. I want to do your commercial because I like it when companies give me an experience.</p>
					<p>I like it when companies make me feel things, rather than just thinking about how much something costs and whether or not I can afford it.</p>
					<p>I like it when companies convince me that a product is so essential to my experience that the price tag is almost invisible.</p>
					<p>And I like it even more when companies let me help them create that effect.</p>
					<strong><p>So, let’s get started.</p></strong>

			<p>You might recognize my voice from the popular YouTube Channels /Start, All Things DnD, IsItThatGame, and others!</p>
			<p>In my time as the narrator for these channels, they have grown from smaller niche channels into big, profitable channels for their creators!</p>
			<p>Don't waste your time with robotic text-to-speech or people who only narrate videos as a hobby. Wouldn't you rather hire someone who makes a fulltime living narrating YouTube videos?</p>
			<p>Whether you need something big and bombastic like a Top 10 List, or something more personal and character driven, I'd love to help you out! :)</p>

			<h1 class="text-center">About Me</h1>
			<p>Mylo Reid is a massively successful voice actor who lives in an eighteen million dollar mansion… Just kidding! Well, at least about the mansion part! ;)</p>
			<p>Who am I really? I’m someone who used to hate the sound of my own voice. I used to hate that feeling of being asked to talk about myself or what I was all about.</p>
			<p>When I went to acting school, this all changed. I became obsessed with how my voice could grow and change and tell new stories I hadn’t told before.</p>
			<p>Not too long after I finished school, I got scouted by a dubbing studio in New York City. I got to play a lot of major and minor characters in about half a dozen series that only air internationally so, no, you probably haven’t seen them, or even heard of them for that matter! :)</p>
			<p>Nowadays, I make my living full time doing a variety of different kinds of voice over jobs. I love being able to be the voice of a new product, idea, or character that might change someone’s life!</p>
			<p>And even though I’m always busy, I’m always ready to be even busier! So if you have some words you need spoken or shrieked, you know where to find me! </p>
